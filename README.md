# Textract

* The main motive behind this project was that we often faced the problem of separately typing any content instead of copy-pasting from an already existing document or image which are not in typed format.

* Hence, a text extractor which would simply scanning and extracting the content of the file would save loads of time and also reduce the chances of typographical error to 0%.

## Application Link:

* Desktop Version (For images & PDF's) : [http://18.222.220.89:5000/](http://18.222.220.89:5000/)
* Mobile Version (Downloadable APK package only for images) : [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLeMwO4LZjzQcbgoA5ARX-z3L8OsZ4-M/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLeMwO4LZjzQcbgoA5ARX-z3L8OsZ4-M/view?usp=sharing)

## Flow of the Application

* Our system takes the scanned image/document from the user as an input.

* Then perform some image pre-processing techniques, like scaling, binarization and noise removal.

* Use Optical Character Recognition using [Tesseract Engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and extract the text.
